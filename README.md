## **Model Training** 🧠  
The AI model behind CryptoHack-AI was built using **GPT-2** as the base model, fine-tuned for idea generation in the crypto and AI domains.

### Training Process:  
1. **Platform**: The training was conducted on **Google Colab**, utilizing its GPU acceleration to efficiently fine-tune the model.  
2. **Dataset Preparation**: The collected data was cleaned, structured, and formatted to suit GPT-2's input requirements.  
3. **Fine-Tuning**: Using Hugging Face’s Transformers library, the model was customized to focus on generating actionable ideas and strategies for crypto and AI projects.  
4. **Evaluation**: Initial results are promising, but there’s room to refine the dataset and enhance the model for better context understanding.

## **Integration** 🗄️  
**Supabase** and **PostgreSQL** were utilized as the backend infrastructure to handle data storage and management:  

- **Supabase**:  
  - Provides a backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform.  
  - Enables real-time data handling and user authentication.  

- **PostgreSQL**:  
  - Stores user queries, project ideas, and preferences for future reference.  
  - Ensures secure and efficient data management for personalized experiences.  

Together, these technologies provide a robust and reliable foundation for CryptoHack-AI's functionality.
