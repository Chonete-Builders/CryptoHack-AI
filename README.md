## **Model Training** üß†

The AI model behind CryptoHack-AI was built using **GPT-2** as the base model, fine-tuned for idea generation in the crypto and AI domains.

### Training Process:

1. **Platform**: The training was conducted on **Google Colab**, utilizing its GPU acceleration to efficiently fine-tune the model.
2. **Dataset Preparation**: The collected data was cleaned, structured, and formatted to suit GPT-2's input requirements.
3. **Fine-Tuning**: Using Hugging Face‚Äôs Transformers library, the model was customized to focus on generating actionable ideas and strategies for crypto and AI projects.
4. **Evaluation**: Initial results are promising, but there‚Äôs room to refine the dataset and enhance the model for better context understanding.

## **Deployment** üöÄ

The trained model was deployed using:

- **Hugging Face Spaces**: Hosting the model on Hugging Face Spaces makes it accessible via API for seamless integration into the application.
- **Vercel**: The app frontend is deployed on **Vercel**, ensuring optimal performance and scalability for end-users.

The deployment combines the AI model with an intuitive UI, enabling users to quickly interact and generate ideas in real-time.

## **Integration** üóÑÔ∏è

**Supabase** and **PostgreSQL** were utilized as the backend infrastructure to handle data storage and management:

- **Supabase**:

  - Provides a backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform.
  - Enables real-time data handling and user authentication.

- **PostgreSQL**:
  - Stores user queries, project ideas, and preferences for future reference.
  - Ensures secure and efficient data management for personalized experiences.

Together, these technologies provide a robust and reliable foundation for CryptoHack-AI's functionality.
